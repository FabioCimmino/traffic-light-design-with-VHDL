# traffic-light-design-with-VHDL

The goal of this project was to create a digital system, with a 100 MHz clock signal, which allows you to manage the operation of a traffic light equipped with three signals (RED, YELLOW and GREEN).
The traffic light can work in different ways and manages the Reset and Enable signals.  
The implementation of this digital system was carried out using VHDL. It is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits.  
for all details on implementation please see the pdf "MODELSIM PROJECT".
